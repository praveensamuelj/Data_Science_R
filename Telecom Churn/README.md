# Telco Churn

## This file contains data from a sample of 7043 subscribers of telephone and/or Internet Services for a large telco. We want to create three separate models to understand the predictors of churn of 
- (i) subscribers of telephone services 
- (ii) subscribers of internet services
- (iii) people who subscribe to both services.

Below is the variable table which I have considered to calculate the churn rate of telephone only, Internet only and internet & telephone customers respectively. To analyze and model them separately, I choose to subset the data. First subset excluding the customers who do not have internet service from the initial data set, which will give me only telephone customers. Second subset excluding the customers who do not have telephone service from the initial data set, which will give me only Internet service customers. Finally, the third one will be customers who have telephone service and have one of the either (DSL/Fiber optics) internet service. I have engineered payment method as automatic or not and Churn variable to num 1 and 0. 

- The first dataset has 1526 data points of which 113 customers have churned. Converted the required categorical columns to factors.
- The Second dataset has 682 data points of which 170 customers have churned. Converted the required categorical columns to factors.
- This final dataset has 4835 data points of which 1586 customers have churned. Converted the required categorical columns to factors.

**Variable**|**Effect**|**Rationale**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
gender|?|Specific gender cannot influence churn rate, but I want to see if there is any bias.
Senior citizen|-|Senior citizens usually dislike change, thus churn rate should be low.
dependent|-|Usually, dependents also will be in the same plan. Thus, churn rate could be low for moving as a group
tenure|-|Longer the customer is with the telco company, lesser are the chances to move.
MultipleLines|-|Easy for customers to have all lines with one company. Churn rate would be low if he/she has a bunch lo lines to move.
InternetService|-/+|Fiber optic is better alternative when compared to DSL in this high speed era, thus churn for Fiber could be low
OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup,DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies|-|Each item of this set is an extra service provided by the company; thus, more are the features less is the churn rate of customers.
Contract|-/+|Longer contracts yield to lesser churn rates as people usually donâ€™t want to break contacts and move. 
PaymentMethod\_auto|-/+|Automatic payment methods, this explains the customer want to have a long tenure with the company, thus low churn rate. 
MonthlyCharges|+|More are the charges more is the chance of customer moving away to cheaper options.
